# Sample_Selection
Sample 1: Astrometric_Selection
The sample is split in the following way:
Sources with 5p solutions
Sources with 6p solutions
Host galaxy detected
No host galaxy detected
Sources identified as galaxy candidates
Sources not identified as galaxy candidates
Sources outside the galactic plane
sqrt_chi2_al_dof ----> sqrt(astrometric_chi2_al/astrometric_n_good_obs_al − N)
(degress of freedom = astrometric_n_good_obs_al − N , N is the number of parameters solved, N=5 for 2-parameter and 5-parameter solutions and 6 for 6-parameter solutions.)
