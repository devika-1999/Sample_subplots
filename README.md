# Sample_Selection
Sample 1: 
# Astrometric_Selection
The sample is split in the following way:
1. Sources with 5p solutions
2. Sources with 6p solutions
3. Host galaxy detected
4. No host galaxy detected
5. Sources identified as galaxy candidates
6. Sources not identified as galaxy candidates
7. Sources outside the galactic plane
8. sqrt_chi2_al_dof ----> sqrt(astrometric_chi2_al/astrometric_n_good_obs_al − N)
(degress of freedom = astrometric_n_good_obs_al − N , N is the number of parameters solved, N=5 for 2-parameter and 5-parameter solutions and 6 for 6-parameter solutions.)
